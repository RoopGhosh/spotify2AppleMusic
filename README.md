## The last step may take hours. Make sure you do it when you wont be using your system....

1. pull up the artifacts forlder . 
2. run Spotify2AppleMusic.jar inside the folder 'Spotify2AppleMusic_jar'
3. to run the jar. use command line : java -jar 'absolute path to jar file'
4. it would prompt you to copy an url to your web browser.
5. after allowing access to my developer App from spotify "playlist extractor" you would be redirectd a linkedIn profile.
6. When you are redirected to the profile, the url contains the access code which is required by the program to move forward.
7. Please copy the complete url now <..linkednin.com/in/rooopghosh/.........> from your web browser.
8. Now that you have the address in your clipboard; move back to the command prompt and press enter.
9. The address is read from the clipboard and all the playlists are preserved in the form of a text file in your user directory.
10. The text file is named 'ExtractedPlaylists.txt'. (Please search if you are unable to find it. ) It is saved in 'user.dir'
11. You may rename and relocate the file ^^ mentioned above for your convinience. 
12. Now open itunes and like the search bar and make sure it searches the Apple music library by default (and not just your library). Quit itunes. Check the behavior again.
12. Now move on to the 2nd jar file <b>SikuliPrototype.jar</b> . use command line : java -jar 'absolute path to jar file'
13. Paste the absolute path to ExtractedPlaylists.txt
14. Sit back and enjoy sikuli which creates a fake mouse and mimics a user action.
